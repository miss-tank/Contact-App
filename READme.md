The app starts off with a main activity containing a welcome message and a button. Upon pressing the button,your app displays a second activity containing a one-line editor field, a button, and a read-only text view. The second activity allows the interactive user to enter the first and last names of a person in the editor field.When the button in his activity is pressed, your app switches to a different app for adding a new contact with the specified first and last name. This app could be the built-in Contacts app in the device, or a different app with similar functionality that the device’s user installed on the device. (You are not responsible for downloading and installing alternative apps for viewing and editing contacts.) Now the device’s user has a chance to enter the new contact’s information. The contacts app must return automatically to your app when a user saves a new contact. Alternatively, the user may choose to return to your app without saving a new contact by pressing the “back” button. Either way, when your app resumes it will display a message in the read-only text field indicating whether the user had successfully saved the new contact or not.
